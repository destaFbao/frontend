# AutoPol BendSim: A Modern 3D Software Solution for Off-line Programming of Press Brakes
 
If you are looking for a software that can help you design, unfold and simulate sheet metal bending operations, you might want to check out AutoPol BendSim. This software is a product of AutoPOL, a company that specializes in developing CAD/CAM solutions for the sheet metal industry. AutoPol BendSim is compatible with all Prima Power P series brakes, as well as other press brake models from different manufacturers.

AutoPol BendSim has many features and benefits that can improve your productivity and quality when working with sheet metal. Some of them are:
 
- Drastic reduction of machine down time: You can create programs on a PC while the machine is producing parts, instead of occupying the machine when programming on the controller.
- Reduced programming time: Programming off-line is faster and easier than on the machine, thanks to the intuitive and graphical user interface.
- Quicker machine set-up: You can generate clear and detailed production reports that show the tooling, sequence, back gauge positions and other information needed for efficient machine preparation.
- Less scrap: You can get accurate flat patterns with AutoPol's unique bend allowance algorithm, which takes into account the material and tooling properties. You can also export the flat patterns as DXF files to be used in punching and cutting machines.
- Elimination of potential manufacturing problems: You can validate your programs before taking them into production, by using the collision detection and simulation features. You can also optimize your production by finding the best bend sequence, tool selection and set-up with AutoPol's smart algorithms.
- Shorter cycle times: You can create more efficient programs with helpful back gauging, smart auto-sequencing and optimized set-ups.

AutoPol BendSim consists of three main modules: BendSim Unfold, 3D Designer and Simulator. BendSim Unfold is a software for calculation of flat-patterns from 3D models created in 3D CAM systems. 3D models can be imported in SAT, Step or Iges formats. Optional translator packages are available for other file formats. BendSim Unfold uses AutoPol's bend allowance algorithm to calculate unfolding patterns. At this stage, the bending tools are taken into account to get radii and correct unfolding dimensions.
 
3D Designer is a software for design and unfolding of basic 3D sheet metal models. You can create simple parts by drawing 2D sketches and extruding them into 3D shapes. You can also add bends, holes, notches and other features to your models. 3D Designer can also unfold your models into flat patterns using AutoPol's algorithm.
 
Simulator is a software for off-line programming of press brakes. It has full covering CAM functionalities that allow you to create programs for any press brake model. Simulator includes collision detection, automatic and manual bend sequencing, automatic and manual tool selection and set-up, automatic back gauge position calculation and advanced editing possibilities, NC-code and documentation creation (PDF format).
